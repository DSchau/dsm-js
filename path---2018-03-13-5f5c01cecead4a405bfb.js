Transducers let us\ncompose our transformation functions (the map and filter) into a single reducer,\nwhich we can use to perform the same functionality on the array, but we\'ll only\nloop over it 1 time.</p>\n<p>This talk will go over the basics of map, filter, reduce and function composition.\nThen build up gradually to transducers.</p>',frontmatter:{meeting:{date:"March 13, 2018",time:{start:"6:00pm",end:"7:00pm"}},sponsor:{name:"Robert Half",site:"https://www.roberthalf.com/ia-des-moines"},host:{location:"Gravitate, 317 6th Ave, Suite 10"},talk:{title:"An Introduction to Transducers",speaker:"Eric Ponto"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2018-03-13/"}}}});
