(More FP jargon coming...) Transducers let us\ncompose our transformation functions (the map and filter) into a single reducer,\nwhich we can use to perform the same functionality on the array, but we\'ll only\nloop over it 1 time.</p>\n<p>This talk will go over the basics of map, filter, reduce and function composition.\nThen build up gradually to transducers.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"An Introduction to Transducers",speaker:{frontmatter:{name:"Eric Ponto"}}}}}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
