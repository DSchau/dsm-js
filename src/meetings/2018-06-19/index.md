Serverless is a super hot topic these days.
You wonâ€™t want to miss this talk by Todd Brunia, Sr. Software Engineer at
Source Allies and founder of Xilution. Through [example](https://github.com/xilution/xilution-react-todomvc),
Todd will demonstrate how you can apply a serverless architecture to your next

his startup entirely on AWS serverless architecture.
